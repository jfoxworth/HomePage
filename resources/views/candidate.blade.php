                <h3>What I want to do as precinct chair</h3>
                
                <p>The GOP is facing a number of problems within the county, the congressional district, and the state. These problems include getting information to our constituents, getting feedback on local and national issues, and an opponent with a web presence that is much more organized. I want to change all of that, so here is what I would do as precinct chair ...</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Start a facebook group for this precinct where residents could get updates on local elections, events, budget meetings, etc</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Ask other precinct chairs to do the same and to post updates regularly</li>
                        <li>Pass these group pages on to new precinct chairs as needed</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Overhaul the county GOP website and all related sites</li>
                    <li>Start building a web platform to facilitate communication between local leaders and constituents for city and county matters</li>
                    <li>Build a service to connect those who want to get involved with local politics with candidates and could use that help</li>
                    <li>Build a service to find and help conservative candidates run for office to contest Democratic offices</li>
                </ul>

                <p>These changes are intended to have the cumulative effect of unifying the GOP and developing leadership that can prevent the state from turning blue in the next decade.</p>

                                        <p>I learned angular some time ago and I have not really moved into the angular 2 camp. While there has been an onslaught of javascript frameworks in the last few years, I have tried to learn the more popular ones to a least some extent. I still find angular to be best for most projects unless it is a small project with just enough complexity to need a framework.</p>

This has led me to look for the line where it is better to solve a problem in the browser with javascript versus calling a python or php script to solve it on the server.</p>

Usually, the amount depends upon the weather and how much stress that I am trying to deal with. A recent knee surgery has lowered my miles significantly.</p>
